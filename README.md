# SUMEE (Lite)

**SUMEE** is a highly stylized, nostalgic iOS launcher and frontend inspired by the **PS Vita** interface and the **Frutiger Aero** design language.

It transforms your iOS navigation experience with 3D bubble icons, "LiveArea" style app pages, floating cartridges, and a fully functional system interface including Music, Photos, and Game integrations.

## Building an IPA (For Sideloading)

To verify the app or share it (e.g., via AltStore, SideStore, or TrollStore), you need to export an `.ipa` file.

1.  **Select "Any iOS Device (arm64)"**:
    - In the device selector (top toolbar), choose **Any iOS Device (arm64)** instead of a specific connected phone.

2.  **Archive**:
    - Go to **Product > Archive** in the menu bar.
    - Xcode will build the project. This may take a few minutes.

3.  **Distribute App**:
    - Once the Organizer window appears with your archive selected, click **Distribute App**.
    - Select **Custom** (or *Ad Hoc* / *Development* depending on your Xcode version options).
    - Choose **App Thinning**: *None* (to make it compatible with all devices) or select your specific model.
    - **Signing**: Select *Automatically manage signing* or manually select your profile.

4.  **Export**:
    - Choose a destination folder on your Mac.
    - Xcode will generate a folder containing `SUMEE.ipa`.

You can now sideload this `SUMEE.ipa` using tools like **AltServer** or **SideStore**.
